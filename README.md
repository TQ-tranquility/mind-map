Mind map of brain functions

Ever wondered why nobody made a mind map of the mind itself? Well now it's been done. A working script to generate mind maps from edgefiles, also included.

See the images directory for examples of what can be done.

Expected interlinks between brain functions in a normal human being are also included.
